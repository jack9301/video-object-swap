# video-object-swap
accompony with openCV,YOLO, numjpy achieve object swap in video

Object Detection and Segmentation: Identify and segment the objects in each frame of the video. Use a pre-trained object detection model (like YOLO, SSD, or Mask R-CNN) to detect objects.

Tracking: Track the detected objects across frames to maintain consistency. You can use algorithms like SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) or Deep SORT for this purpose.

Object Replacement: Replace the detected objects with the desired objects. This involves image processing techniques to ensure the new objects blend seamlessly into the frames.

Rendering: Render the modified frames back into a video format.

To provide a more detailed guide, I'll create a Python script that uses OpenCV and a pre-trained object detection model (like YOLO) to detect and swap objects in a video.

Python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load YOLO
net = cv2.dnn.readNet("yolov3.weights", "yolov3.cfg")
layer_names = net.getLayerNames()
output_layers = [layer_names[i[0] - 1] for i in net.getUnconnectedOutLayers()]

# Load video
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("input_video.mp4")

# Desired object image to replace
replacement_image = cv2.imread("replacement.png")

fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
out = cv2.VideoWriter('output_video.avi', fourcc, 20.0, (int(cap.get(3)), int(cap.get(4))))

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    height, width, channels = frame.shape

    # Detecting objects
    blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(frame, 0.00392, (416, 416), (0, 0, 0), True, crop=False)
    net.setInput(blob)
    outs = net.forward(output_layers)

    class_ids = []
    confidences = []
    boxes = []

    for out in outs:
        for detection in out:
            scores = detection[5:]
            class_id = np.argmax(scores)
            confidence = scores[class_id]
            if confidence > 0.5:
                # Object detected
                center_x = int(detection[0] * width)
                center_y = int(detection[1] * height)
                w = int(detection[2] * width)
                h = int(detection[3] * height)

                # Rectangle coordinates
                x = int(center_x - w / 2)
                y = int(center_y - h / 2)
                
                boxes.append([x, y, w, h])
                confidences.append(float(confidence))
                class_ids.append(class_id)
    
    indexes = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)

    for i in range(len(boxes)):
        if i in indexes:
            x, y, w, h = boxes[i]
            roi = frame[y:y+h, x:x+w]
            replacement_resized = cv2.resize(replacement_image, (w, h))
            frame[y:y+h, x:x+w] = replacement_resized

    out.write(frame)
    cv2.imshow('frame', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
out.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

Instructions:
Ensure you have OpenCV and numpy installed. You can install them using pip install opencv-python numpy.
Download the YOLO weights and cfg files from the official YOLO website or GitHub repository.
Replace "input_video.mp4" with the path to your input video file.
Replace "replacement.png" with the path to the image you want to use for object replacement.
This script is a basic implementation and might need adjustments based on your specific requirements and the complexity of the video.
